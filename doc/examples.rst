Example notebooks
===============
tobac is provided with a set of Jupyter notebooks that show examples of the application of tobac for different types of datasets.

The notebooks can be found in a separate repository:

`https://github.com/climate-processes/tobac-tutorials <https://github.com/climate-processes/tobac-tutorials>`_


The necessary input data for these examples is avaliable on zenodo:
www.zenodo.org/...
and can be downloaded automatically by the Jupyter notebooks.

The examples currently include four different applications of tobac:
1. Tracking of scattered convection based on vertical velocity and condensate mixing ratio for 3D cloud-resolving model output.
2. Tracking of scattered convection based on surface precipitation from the same cloud-resolving model output
3. Tracking of convective clouds based on outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) for convection-permitting model simulation output
4. Tracking of convective clouds based on OLR in geostationary satellite retrievals.
